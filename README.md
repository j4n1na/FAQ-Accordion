## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox


### What I learned

### 1. Managing state with aria-expanded for accessibility
Using the aria-expanded attribute on buttons is crucial for screen readers to communicate the current state of each accordion item. It improves accessibility and makes the UI more inclusive.

```html
<button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="answer1" id="question1">
  What is Frontend Mentor?
</button>
<div id="answer1" role="region" aria-labelledby="question1" hidden>
  Frontend Mentor offers realistic coding challenges...
</div>
```

### 2. Smooth accordion animations using CSS transitions and JavaScript
I learned how to use max-height with CSS transitions to smoothly open and close the accordion content. Since max-height cannot transition to/from auto, I used JavaScript to dynamically set the height based on contentâ€™s scrollHeight.

```js
if (button.getAttribute('aria-expanded') === 'true') {
  answer.style.maxHeight = null;  // closes the accordion
} else {
  answer.style.maxHeight = answer.scrollHeight + 'px';  // opens it smoothly
}
```

### 3. Ensuring only one accordion item is open at a time
To improve usability, I implemented logic that closes all other accordion items when opening a new one. This involved looping through all buttons and resetting their state before opening the clicked one.

```js
accordionButtons.forEach(btn => {
  btn.setAttribute('aria-expanded', 'false');
  btn.nextElementSibling.style.maxHeight = null;
  btn.querySelector('.icon').src = './assets/images/icon-plus.svg';
});
```
